# This is a test markdown file

### Made with <3 using [oxalorg/sakura.css](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura)

Thank you for your time to try this out!

## Basic formatting

Paragraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.

Paragraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.

### Unordered list

* An item
* Another item
* Yet another item
* And there's more...

### Code block

    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.

You can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.

Github style code blocks:

```python
title = 'Test markdown'
with open(os.path.join(
        os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)), 'test.md')) as f:
    content = f.read()
Preview(title, content).preview()
```
